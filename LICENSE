The use of the word "Scrapy" in the title of my project is descriptive, 
as this is a library built for use with Scrapy projects. It should not 
be construed as any kind of endorsement by the Scrapy developers.

This library involves signifcant use of code from both the "Scrapy" 
library by Scrapy developers, and of code from the "Scrapy Autounit" 
library by Scrapinghub. This is both in the form of imported functions 
and functions embedded natively in the files.
